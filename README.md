The task for this project is to  provide a program solution to the Lowest Common Ancestor problem.

For this particular project, we are working under the assymption that the graph is structured as a binary tree.

The instructions for this project are as follows

*   Choose a unit testing framework
*   Create a repository on a git service
*   Define a set of initial unit tests that capture the basic expected behavior by creating sample data and identifying the basic API for the LCA solution
*   Build the initial solition testing it against the test code until it is working
*   Refine the solution, expanding the test cases to deal with awkward parameters and edge cases that push the limits of the solution, enhacing the solution to deal with these cases
